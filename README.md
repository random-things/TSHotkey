# TSHotkey

### Description
Binds touchscreen enable/disable to a global keyboard shortcut. Particularly useful for laptops that suffer from the touchscreen clicking itself AKA "ghost touches".

### Installation
Copy TSHotkey.exe to your startup programs folder. To do this, <kbd>meta</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> to open a Run dialog and type `shell:startup`. This will open your startup programs folder.

Note: You must also set TSHotkey.exe to run as an administrator. This is because Administrator access is required to enable and disable devices. To do this, right click on TSHotkey.exe, go to te Compatibility tab, and check the box next to "Run as an administrator".

### Use
Uses <kbd>ctrl</kdb>+<kdb>alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> to enable/disable the touchscreen.
